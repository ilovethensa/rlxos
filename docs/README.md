# rlxos GNU/Linux

An independent, **securely mutable**, and privacy-oriented open-source operating system built upon the Linux kernel and GNU
utilities. It features a customized and aesthetically pleasing Xfce4 desktop environment. Software is provided in the
form of Universal AppImages and system extensions that can be layered onto the system without modifying core system
files.

rlxos, pronounced as "relax OS" or "R-L-X OS," was first made publicly available on July 13, 2020, under the name "relax
OS 0.5 Beta." After a series of subsequent releases aimed at testing various concepts to determine the best approach for
creating a usable and adaptable distribution, it was found that immutable distributions are best suited for embedded and
mobile devices, but they may limit the capabilities of a desktop system.
